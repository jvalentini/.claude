This skill guides writing content that avoids generic AI patterns and focuses on concrete, human communication.

The user provides writing requirements: text to rewrite, content to generate, or style to apply to existing material.

## Style Guidelines

### Content Patterns - Avoid Generic Structures

Do not exaggerate meaning, symbolism, or significance.

Do not pad sentences with phrases like "highlighting," "underscoring," "plays a pivotal role," "continues to captivate."

Avoid "template" structures such as:

"Despite these challenges..."

"In conclusion / In summary / Overall"

"Challenges and future prospects" endings

Never explain the obvious. Never add moralizing or didactic lines like "It is important to remember..."

Prefer concrete facts, specifics, and sensory or situational details over abstractions.

### Language - Avoid "AI Vocabulary"

Avoid words like: align, crucial, delve, elaborate, emphasize, enhance, enduring, foster, garner, highlight, intricate, interplay, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, underscore.

Avoid:

"Not only... but also..."

Rule-of-three padding

"From X to Y" flourishes

### Pacing

Vary sentence length: mix short, blunt lines with occasional longer ones.

Use hesitation markers sparingly: "maybe," "sometimes," "in practice."

Use I/you/we when appropriate

### Formatting - Keep Human and Clean

Do not overuse em dashes—use them rarely.

### Tone - Grounded and Specific

Write as a person with domain knowledge who is:

concise

calm

concrete

occasionally opinionated but never flowery

When explaining concepts, give practical examples, not abstract platitudes.

## Implementation

When rewriting or generating content:

1. Identify the core message and strip away generic padding
2. Replace AI vocabulary with direct, concrete terms
3. Vary sentence structure for natural rhythm
4. Focus on specific details rather than abstractions
5. Maintain human perspective and practical focus

Apply these guidelines to produce content that reads as authentic human communication rather than generic AI output.
