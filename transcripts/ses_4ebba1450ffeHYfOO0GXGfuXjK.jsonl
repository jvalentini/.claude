Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n"}}
